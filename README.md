# Claude Desktop Extension

Add automation capabilities to Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and use Claude Desktop as a model gateway for Claude Code.

## Project Overview

This is a **Claude Desktop Extension** project that adds automation capabilities to Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and enables using Claude Desktop as a model gateway for Claude Code. Core communication between services is operational with documented fixes for ESM loading, JSON validation, and file monitoring issues.

## Key Purposes

1. **Claude Desktop Extension**: Direct tool integration with Claude Desktop through MCP - eliminates need for API key configuration in multiple tools
2. **Model Gateway**: Using Claude Desktop as a model provider for Claude Code - leverages single authenticated session for all requests
3. **Development Tools**: Enhanced development capabilities with browser context integration - full-stack debugging with network data
4. **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom functionality - modular tool deployment without core system changes
5. **Bidirectional Communication**: File-based message passing between Claude Desktop and Claude Code - enables cross-platform workflow automation

## WSL/Windows Integration: The Core Architectural Challenge

This project addresses a fundamental challenge:

### Two Different Execution Environments on One Machine

```
Claude Desktop: Running on Windows (native app)
Claude Code: Running in WSL (Linux subsystem)
Problem: They're on the same machine but in different operating environments
```

This explains everything about the project's architecture:

### Why the Python Scripts Exist

They were designed specifically for this WSL/Windows cross-boundary communication challenge:

- File-based communication through shared mount points (`/mnt/c/Users/dimas/`)
- Process isolation handling between Windows and Linux environments
- Configuration synchronization across different file system roots

### Why This Architecture is Brilliant

The "remote" bridge design isn't just for different machines - it's essential for WSL/Windows integration:

```
Windows Claude Desktop ←→ Shared Files ←→ WSL Claude Code
     (Consumer)              (Bridge)         (Executor)
```

## Core Architecture

### Two-Tier System

**Basic Extension Tier:**
- MCP Server (`custom-claude-mcp.js`) - Provides tools to Claude Desktop
- Bridge Process (`claude-desktop-bridge.js`) - Monitors and executes actions
- Plugin System - Extensible tool framework

**Model Gateway Tier:**
- Dev Hub MCP Server (`dev-hub-mcp-server.js`) - Routes Claude Code requests
- Desktop Gateway (`claude-desktop-gateway.js`) - Interfaces with Claude Desktop
- Session Manager (`session-manager.js`) - Handles authentication across apps

### Communication Patterns

- **WebSocket**: MCP protocol communication (original implementation)
- **Stdio**: Direct stdin/stdout communication for Claude Desktop (recommended)
- **File-based**: Shared directory communication between services (verified working)
- **Session tokens**: Secure cross-application authentication

```

## Claude Code Integration (WSL)

### Installation and Setup
Use the provided WSL toolkit for installing Claude Code:

1. **Installation Script**: `install-claude-code-wsl.bat`
   - Targets Ubuntu-24.04 WSL distribution
   - Sets up npm global directory to avoid permission issues
   - Multiple fallback installation methods

2. **Launcher**: `run-claude-code.bat`
   - Launches Claude Code from Windows
   - Checks multiple executable locations

3. **Launch Command**:
   ```
   c:\Users\dimas\Desktop\"CLAUDE CODE ToolKIT WSL Edition"\run-claude-code.bat
   ```

### Key Integration Points
- **Path Limitations**: Claude Code can only access files in its starting directory and subdirectories
- **WSL Communication**: Uses file-based communication through shared directories
- **Project Context**: Launch from project directory for full access

### File-Based Bridge Setup
- Shared directory: `C:\Users\dimas\claude-bridge\` (Windows) = `/mnt/c/Users/dimas/claude-bridge/` (WSL)
- Command queue: Files in the pending directory
- Results queue: Files in the completed directory
- Authentication: Shared via `claude-env.bat` and authentication sync

## Implementation Details and Fixes Applied

### Critical Issues Resolved
1. **ESM Loader Path Issues**: Fixed plugin loading on Windows
2. **Session State File Spam**: Prevented feedback loops in file monitoring
3. **WSL Path Resolution**: Added proper Windows/WSL path handling
4. **Bridge Functionality**: Implemented missing helper functions
5. **MCP Protocol**: Full WebSocket and JSON-RPC implementation

### Runtime Dependencies (Verified)
- Node.js 18+ (tested with Node.js 22.14.0)
- `ws` - WebSocket communication ✅
- `chokidar` - File watching ✅
- `node-fetch` - HTTP requests ✅

## Troubleshooting JSON Parsing Errors

### Issue Description
During plugin/tool initialization, the system encountered JSON parsing errors with the following error message:
```
Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON at position 5 (line 1 column 6)
```

This error prevented proper tool initialization in Claude Desktop, causing some plugins to fail loading and tools to be unavailable.

### 🎉 SUCCESS! Complete Resolution Achieved

After thorough investigation and multiple approaches, we have completely resolved the JSON parsing errors. The logs now show no errors, and the system is functioning perfectly.

### Final Root Cause Analysis

The true root cause was identified:
- Claude Desktop was trying to parse console.log output from the WebSocket-based server as JSON-RPC messages
- The WebSocket server was writing logs to stdout, which Claude Desktop's stdio transport was interpreting as malformed JSON responses
- This created the appearance of JSON syntax errors in tool definitions

### Complete Solution Implemented

1. **Created a proper stdio-based MCP server** (`custom-claude-mcp-stdio.js`):
   - Uses stdin/stdout exclusively for JSON-RPC communication
   - No console logs to stdout that could interfere with JSON-RPC protocol
   - All logging redirected to file only
   - Proper message serialization with JSON validation

2. **Updated communication protocol:**
   - Switched from WebSocket to stdio transport
   - Updated session state to reflect `"transport": "stdio"` and `"port": null`
   - Full JSON-RPC implementation with proper message handling

### Key Code Changes

1. **Added Tool Parameter Serialization and Validation**:
   ```javascript
   function validateToolParameters(tool) {
     try {
       // Validate each parameter has proper structure
       if (tool.parameters) {
         // Deep clone and re-serialize to ensure valid JSON
         const serialized = JSON.stringify(tool.parameters);
         const deserialized = JSON.parse(serialized);
         tool.parameters = deserialized;
       }
       return true;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Tool parameter validation failed for ${tool.name}: ${error.message}`);
       return false;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Enhanced Plugin Loading**:
   ```javascript
   function loadPlugin(pluginPath) {
     try {
       const plugin = require(pluginPath);
       if (!plugin.tools || !Array.isArray(plugin.tools)) {
         console.error(`Plugin at ${pluginPath} does not export tools array`);
         return [];
       }
       
       // Validate each tool in the plugin
       return plugin.tools.filter(tool => {
         if (!validateToolParameters(tool)) {
           console.error(`Skipping tool ${tool.name} due to parameter validation failure`);
           return false;
         }
         return true;
       });
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Failed to load plugin at ${pluginPath}: ${error.message}`);
       return [];
     }
   }
   ```

## Development Workflow (Tested)

1. **Installation**: 
   ```bash
   cd Claude_Automation
   npm install
   ```

2. **Starting Services**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:all
   ```

3. **Testing**: Use test scripts in `scripts/` directory ✅
4. **Debugging**: Check logs in `logs/` directory ✅
5. **Extensions**: Add plugins to `plugins/` directory ✅
6. **Configuration**: Update configs in `config/` directory ✅

## Monitoring and Debugging Suite

This project includes a comprehensive suite of monitoring and debugging tools designed to provide complete, end-to-end visibility into the system. It is managed via a user-friendly batch file launcher, making it accessible regardless of your PowerShell experience.

### Quick Start: The First Step for Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing any issues, especially silent tool call failures, start here.

1.  Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the main launcher:
    ```
    .\monitoring-tools.bat
    ```
3.  This will open a simple menu. **Choose option `[1] Live Tool Call Debugger`**.
4.  With the live debugger running, perform the action in Claude Desktop that is failing.
5.  Watch the debugger dashboard for a real-time, conclusive breakdown of the request and the resulting success or failure.

### Diagnostic Workflow

For any problem, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Run `monitoring-tools.bat` → Choose Option `[6]` (Validate All Scripts).** This ensures no scripts are broken.
2.  **Run `monitoring-tools.bat` → Choose Option `[1]` (Live Tool Call Debugger).** This is your main window into the system.
3.  **Perform an action in Claude Desktop** that uses a tool.
4.  **Check the live debugger** for the exact failure point: the JSON request, the response, the error message, and the status of the underlying processes.

### Visualizing the Monitoring Coverage

Our tools provide visibility at every critical step of the communication flow:

```
[Claude Desktop] -> [MCP Server] -> [Bridge Process] -> [WSL Claude Code]
      ▲                 ▲                  ▲                  ▲
      |                 |                  |                  |
(tool-call-      (Port & Process)    (File Activity)   (WSL Process)
 debugger)        (system-monitor)    (bridge-monitor)  (system-monitor)
```

### Components of the Monitoring Suite

The system is comprised of several key components, all accessible from the main launcher:

1.  **`monitoring-tools.bat` (Main Launcher):**
    *   A simple, robust menu for launching all monitoring and utility scripts.
    *   Automatically handles PowerShell `ExecutionPolicy` so scripts run without hassle.

    *   **Purpose:** A utility to guarantee that all PowerShell scripts are free of syntax errors.
    *   **Features:** Uses the official PowerShell language parser to accurately check every script, providing immediate feedback if a script is broken.

6.  **`claude-master-control.ps1` (Master Controller):**
    *   **Purpose:** The underlying engine for starting, stopping, and managing the lifecycle of all services.
    *   **Features:** Provides `start`, `stop`, and `debug` actions to manage the entire environment.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Plugin Loading Errors**: Fixed with proper ESM file URL handling
2. **Session State Spam**: Resolved with timestamp-based change detection
3. **Path Issues**: WSL-aware path resolution implemented
4. **Connection Problems**: Verify Claude Desktop is running and MCP server on port 4323

### Log Locations
- MCP Server (WebSocket): `logs/mcp-server.log`
- MCP Server (Stdio): `logs/mcp-server-stdio.log`
- Bridge Process: `logs/bridge.log`
- Session State: `%APPDATA%\Claude\session_state.json`
- Claude Desktop MCP Extension: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\mcp-server-custom-extension.log`
- Claude Desktop Main: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\main.log`

### Automated Log Monitoring
The `start-claude-admin-with-monitoring.ps1` script automatically opens separate monitoring windows for:
- MCP Server log (stdio or WebSocket version based on configuration)
- Bridge log
- Claude Desktop MCP Extension log
- Claude Desktop Main log

This allows for real-time monitoring of all system components and simplified troubleshooting.

## Useful Commands for Development and Troubleshooting

During the troubleshooting process, we used a variety of commands to manage services, check logs, and test functionality. Here's a comprehensive list of these commands for future reference:

### Starting and Stopping Services

**Starting all services:**
```powershell
# From project root
npm run start:all

# Or using the batch file
.\start.bat
```

**Starting only the model gateway:**
```powershell
npm run start:model-gateway

# Or using the batch file
.\start-model-gateway.bat
```

**Stopping services:**
```powershell
# Find Node.js processes
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq "node" }

# Kill specific Node.js process by ID
Stop-Process -Id <process_id>

# Kill all Node.js processes
Get-Process -Name "node" | Stop-Process
```

**Restarting MCP server:**
```powershell
# Kill the MCP server process
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -like "*custom-claude-mcp.js*" } | Stop-Process

# Start it again
node .\src\custom-claude-mcp.js
```

### Checking Logs

**Viewing log files:**
```powershell
# MCP server log
Get-Content -Path .\logs\mcp-server.log -Tail 20 -Wait

# Bridge process log
Get-Content -Path .\logs\bridge.log -Tail 20 -Wait

# Claude Desktop extension logs
Get-Content -Path "$env:APPDATA\Claude\logs\mcp-server-custom-extension.log" -Tail 20 -Wait
Get-Content -Path "$env:APPDATA\Claude\logs\main.log" -Tail 20 -Wait
```

**Clearing log files:**
```powershell
# Clear MCP server log
Clear-Content -Path .\logs\mcp-server.log

# Clear bridge log
Clear-Content -Path .\logs\bridge.log
```

### Testing Communication

**Testing MCP server connection:**
```powershell
# Check if MCP server is responding
curl http://localhost:4323/.identity

# Expected response: {"name":"Claude Desktop Extension","version":"1.0.0"}
```

**Creating test triggers for the bridge:**
```powershell
# Create a test trigger file
$triggerContent = @{
  id = "test-trigger-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMddHHmmss')"
  action = "test"
  parameters = @{
    message = "This is a test trigger"
  }
} | ConvertTo-Json

# Save to the triggers directory
$triggerContent | Out-File -FilePath "$env:APPDATA\Claude\code_triggers\test-trigger.json"
```

## MCP Architecture and Configuration Insights

Understanding the relationship between the different configuration files is crucial:

1. **Claude Desktop Application Config**:
   - Located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AnthropicClaude\config.json`
   - Controls whether Claude Desktop auto-starts MCP servers
   - Points to the location of the MCP server config via `configPath`

2. **Claude Desktop MCP Server Config**:
   - Located at `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Defines how Claude Desktop launches external MCP servers
   - Contains `command`, `args`, `env`, and `cwd` settings

3. **MCP Server's Internal Config**:
   - Located within the MCP server's directory (e.g., `claude-config.json`)
   - Used by the MCP server code itself to configure its behavior
   - Not directly used by Claude Desktop

### Race Conditions in MCP Server Startup

A critical issue we encountered was race conditions during MCP server startup:

1. **Multiple Start Attempts**:
   - Claude Desktop may try to start an MCP server even if one is already running
   - This leads to `EADDRINUSE` errors on port 4323
   - Error message: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4323`

### Best Practices for Claude Desktop MCP Extensions

Based on our experience, here are best practices for developing Claude Desktop MCP extensions:

1. **JSON Handling**:
   - Always validate JSON before sending to Claude Desktop
   - Remove trailing commas in arrays and objects
   - Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` to sanitize objects before transmission

2. **Port Management**:
   - Use ports above 1024 to avoid admin requirements
   - Implement proper port conflict detection and resolution
   - Add retry logic for port binding with exponential backoff

3. **Process Management**:
   - Implement lock files to prevent multiple instances
   - Clean up resources on process exit
   - Handle signals properly (SIGINT, SIGTERM)

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Start Services**: `.\start-claude-admin-with-monitoring.ps1`
3. **Launch Claude Code**: Use the WSL toolkit launcher
4. **Verify Connection**: Check logs for successful communication
5. **Begin Development**: All systems operational and ready for use

### Running Claude Desktop in Administrator Mode

For some functionality, particularly when experiencing permission issues with file operations or plugin loading, running Claude Desktop as an administrator can resolve these problems.

#### Method 1: Using PowerShell (Recommended)
Create a PowerShell script (`run-claude-admin.ps1`) with the following content:
```powershell
# Request elevation if not already running as admin
if (-NOT ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] "Administrator")) {
    Start-Process powershell.exe "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `"$PSCommandPath`"" -Verb RunAs
    exit
}

# Path to Claude Desktop executable
$claudePath = "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\Claude\Claude.exe"

# Start Claude Desktop as admin
Start-Process -FilePath $claudePath
```

Run the script by right-clicking and selecting "Run with PowerShell".

#### Method 2: Using Desktop Shortcut
1. Right-click on your Claude Desktop shortcut
2. Select "Properties"
3. Click "Advanced..." button
4. Check "Run as administrator"
5. Click "OK" and "Apply"

## Known Issues and Improvement Opportunities

Based on a comprehensive code review, the following issues and improvement opportunities have been identified:

1. **Mixed stdout discipline**: The stdio server properly avoids stdout, but plugins and bridge still use `console.log`, which could bleed into Desktop if hosted via stdio.

2. **Path traversal risk**: The file-operations plugin allows `../` traversal in file paths. Add a root whitelist or `path.resolve` guard.

3. **Session manager integration**: The session-manager.js appears underutilized. Consider better integration or removal.

4. **Race condition protection**: Lock file mechanism exists in start-services.js but not in all components. Standardize this approach.

5. **Configuration overwriting**: update-claude-config.js replaces the entire configuration file, potentially losing custom settings. Implement proper merging.

6. **WSL distribution detection**: Now more flexible with distribution naming, but could benefit from further parameterization.

7. **Documentation updates needed**: Several documentation files still reference WebSocket as default instead of stdio.

## Latest Fixes and Improvements

The most recent improvements to the codebase include:

1. **Stdio transport adoption**: Switched from WebSocket to stdio transport for more reliable communication.

2. **JSON validation**: Implemented robust JSON validation to prevent parsing errors.

3. **WSL authentication synchronization**: Added automatic WSL credential sharing.

4. **Comprehensive monitoring**: Created PowerShell script for complete setup with real-time log monitoring.

5. **Lock file mechanism**: Implemented process isolation to prevent multiple instance conflicts.

6. **WSL distribution detection**: Enhanced WSL Ubuntu detection to support various naming formats.

A complete changelog is available in the `docs/CHANGELOG.md` file.
