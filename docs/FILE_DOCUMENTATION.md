## Implementation Details and Runtime Analysis

The following section provides detailed analysis of the actual runtime behavior, interdependencies, and known issues discovered through code inspection.

### Execution Flow

1. The entry point defined in `package.json` is `src/custom-claude-mcp.js`, which starts an MCP server
2. The MCP server:
   - Reads configuration from `config/claude-config.json`
   - Binds to port 4323 (default)
   - Exposes the MCP identity endpoint at `/.identity`
   - Dynamically loads all plugins from the `plugins/` directory
   - Merges plugin tools into its global tools array
   - Initializes WebSocket handlers for client connections

3. When the system is started via `start-services.js`:
   - The MCP server is launched first
   - After a two-second delay, `src/claude-desktop-bridge.js` is started as a separate process
   - The bridge monitors `AppData/Roaming/Claude/session_state.json` for pending actions
   - Actions are processed through an event-driven watcher system

### Known Issues

The current implementation has several critical issues that prevent proper functionality:

1. **Missing Bridge Functions**:
   - The bridge calls `updateBridgeStatus()` in multiple places, but this function is not defined
   - Several helper functions referenced in `processCodeTrigger()` are missing:
     - `openConversation`
     - `switchModel`
     - `analyzeFile`
     - `saveConversation`
   - Since the code uses strict mode (Node ESM default), these undefined references cause runtime errors

2. **Claude Desktop Detection Issues**:
   - The bridge checks for Claude Desktop using `tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq claude.exe"` (lowercase)
   - However, the actual process name is typically `Claude.exe` with a capital C
   - This causes the `isClaudeDesktopRunning()` function to always return `false`
   - The bridge may repeatedly attempt to launch Claude, potentially creating multiple instances

3. **Incomplete Integration**:
   - The Development Hub server correctly writes requests to `%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\Claude\\code_requests`
   - However, the bridge lacks the logic to read and process these request files
   - This causes Dev-Hub calls to stall until timeout (120 seconds)

4. **Platform Dependencies**:
   - The code hardcodes Windows paths (`AppData\\Roaming`)
   - No support for macOS (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude`) or Linux (`~/.config/Claude`)
   - Some functions (like `getProjectStructure()`) use PowerShell commands that are Windows-specific

5. **Session Management Gaps**:
   - `session-manager.js` creates and maintains `authenticated_sessions.json`
   - However, no component actually imports or uses its `verifySession` method
   - Session tokens are effectively never verified or enforced

### Minimal Fixes Required

To make the system operational, these minimal changes are needed:

1. Add the missing bridge status function:
```js
function updateBridgeStatus(state) {
  try {
    const ss = fs.existsSync(sessionStatePath)
      ? JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(sessionStatePath, 'utf8'))
      : {};
    ss.bridge_info = ss.bridge_info || {};
    ss.bridge_info.status = state;
    ss.bridge_info.timestamp = Date.now();
    fs.writeFileSync(sessionStatePath, JSON.stringify(ss, null, 2));
  } catch (err) {
    logger.error(`updateBridgeStatus failed: ${err.message}`);
  }
}
```

2. Add stub implementations for the missing helper functions:
```js
async function openConversation() { return { success: true }; }
async function switchModel()     { return { success: true }; }
async function analyzeFile()     { return { success: true }; }
async function saveConversation(){ return { success: true }; }
```

3. Fix Claude Desktop detection by modifying the process name check to be case-insensitive

4. Add platform-specific path resolution for Claude configuration directories

### Runtime Dependencies

The project has minimal external dependencies:
- `ws` - For WebSocket communication
- `chokidar` - For file system watching
- `node-fetch` - For HTTP requests

These are correctly specified in `package.json` and resolve properly under Node 18+.

### Node.js Compatibility

- The project is configured as an ES module package (`"type":"module"` in `package.json`)
- Node.js 18 LTS or newer is recommended to avoid `"ERR_REQUIRE_ESM"` errors
- Node.js 16 may work but ESM support is experimental in that version
