# Custom Claude MCP Implementation

This document provides detailed information about the custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Claude Desktop in this project.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized protocol for interacting with AI models, providing a framework for:

- Sending requests to models
- Managing conversation context
- Registering and executing tools
- Handling model responses

This project implements a custom version of MCP specifically designed for Claude Desktop, enabling it to:

1. Support automation capabilities
2. Integrate with development tools
3. Act as a model gateway for other applications
4. Provide file system and code context tools

## MCP Server Implementation

The custom MCP server is implemented in `dev-hub-mcp-server.js` and includes:

### Core MCP Endpoints

- `/mcp/messages`: For sending messages to Claude
- `/mcp/stream`: For streaming responses from Claude
- `/mcp/tools`: For registering tools with the MCP server
- `/mcp/sessions`: For managing conversation sessions

### Custom Extensions

- Development-specific endpoints for IDE integration
- Code context handling for programming tasks
- File system operations within controlled environments
- Session management extensions

## Tool Registration

The custom MCP implementation supports tool registration through:

1. Static tool definitions in configuration
2. Dynamic tool registration at runtime
3. Plugin-based tool extensions

Tools are defined with:

- A unique name
- Input parameter schema (using JSON Schema)
- Output schema
- Execution handler
- Optional description and authentication requirements

Example tool definition:
```javascript
{
  name: "file_read",
  description: "Read the contents of a file",
  parameters: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      path: {
        type: "string",
        description: "The path to the file to read"
      }
    },
    required: ["path"]
  },
  handler: async (params) => {
    // Implementation of file reading logic
  }
}
```

## Tool Execution Flow

When a tool is executed:

1. The client sends a request with tool name and parameters
2. The MCP server validates the parameters against the schema
3. The server locates the appropriate tool handler
4. The handler is executed with the provided parameters
5. Results are returned to the client
6. The tool execution and result are added to the conversation context

## Custom Claude Tools

The implementation includes several custom tools for Claude:

### File System Tools

- `file_read`: Read file contents
- `file_write`: Write to files
- `file_list`: List directory contents
- `file_search`: Search for files with pattern matching

### Code Tools

- `code_completion`: Get code completion suggestions
- `code_explanation`: Explain code segments
- `code_review`: Review code for issues
- `code_refactor`: Suggest code refactoring

### Development Tools

- `run_command`: Execute shell commands
- `debug_info`: Get debugging information
- `project_structure`: Analyze project structure
- `dependency_info`: Get information about dependencies

## Context Management

The custom MCP implementation includes enhanced context management:

- Persistent conversation history
- Code context from editors
- Project structure context
- Environment context (OS, installed tools, etc.)
- User preference context

Context is maintained across sessions and can be selectively included in requests to Claude.

## Authentication and Security

The MCP implementation includes several security features:

- API key-based authentication
- Session token validation
- Tool permission controls
- Sandboxed tool execution
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and request throttling

## Protocol Extensions

Beyond the standard MCP, this implementation includes extensions for:

### Development Context

- IDE integration endpoints
- Project context handling
- Code completion and analysis

### Custom Response Formats

- Structured output for development tools
- Formatted code responses
- File system operation results

### Streaming Extensions

- Progress updates during long operations
- Partial results for large responses
- Cancellable operations

## Integration with Claude Desktop

The custom MCP connects with Claude Desktop through:

1. The Claude Desktop Gateway (`claude-desktop-gateway.js`)
2. File-based communication via the bridge
3. Session synchronization
4. Context sharing between MCP and Claude Desktop

## Client Libraries

Custom client libraries are provided for different use cases:

- `claude-desktop-client.py`: Python client for the bridge
- `dev-hub-client.js`: JavaScript client for development tools
- `claude-code-client.js`: Client for code-related functionality

## Configuration

The MCP server is configured through:

- `claude-config.json`: Basic configuration
- `dev-hub-config.json`: Development hub specific settings
- Environment variables for deployment-specific settings
- Runtime configuration updates

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- Well-defined error responses with codes and messages
- Graceful degradation when tools fail
- Automatic retries for transient failures
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Limitations

Current limitations of the custom MCP implementation:

- Limited concurrent request handling
- Some operations may have timeout constraints
- Tool execution environment restrictions
- Dependency on Claude Desktop's stability

## Future Extensions

Planned extensions to the MCP implementation:

- Additional language support for code tools
- Enhanced project analysis capabilities
- Expanded file operation tools
- Improved streaming response handling
- Multi-model support
