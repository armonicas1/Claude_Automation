# Main requirements file for Python Bridge components
# This is a convenience file that installs base and OS-specific dependencies
# For specialized environments, use the files in the requirements/ directory directly

# Choose the appropriate environment:
-r requirements/base.txt

# Conditional imports based on platform
# These will be installed only on the appropriate platforms
pywin32>=303; sys_platform == 'win32'  # Windows-specific functionality
# NOTE: We use custom WSL utilities instead of wslapi (see src/utils/wsl/)
pyperclip>=1.8.2        # Cross-platform clipboard access

# Optional API integration
# Uncomment if needed:
# -r requirements/api.txt
